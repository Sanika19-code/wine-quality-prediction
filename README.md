Predicting wine quality using Random Forest, SGD, and SVC with data visualization &amp; insights.
# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Includes data visualization, model comparison, and insights.

## 📂 Files
- `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full project code & explanations.
- `WineQT.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
2. Open `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells.

## 📊 Results
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models.
